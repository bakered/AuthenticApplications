# Employers Use Social Media

.bullet[
- 70% employers use social networking sites to research candidates

- Of those, 57% found content that caused them not to hire candidates

- 47% say if they can't find a job candidate online, they are less likely to call that person for an interview

(Source: [Career Builder Survey](https://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-08-09-More-Than-Half-of-Employers-Have-Found-Content-on-Social-Media-That-Caused-Them-NOT-to-Hire-a-Candidate-According-to-Recent-CareerBuilder-Survey) of 1,012 hiring and human resource managers, 2018)

# Effects of Social Media 

1. Employers have gained access to better signal of candidate quality  
$\rightarrow$ more efficient matching

2. Candidates private lives more visible to employers  
$\rightarrow$ Candidates change behaviour

---

# Research Questions

1. How do application reviewers weigh social media info compared to traditional CV info?

2. How do application reviewers react to contradictory info in SM and CV?

3. Does revealing mental health issues on SM hinder a job applicant? 

4. Does a lack of online presence hinder a job applicant?
